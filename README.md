# TwitterBubblePopper
Twitter can be a bubble. This program will select 20 people who have liked each of your last 20 liked tweets (400 total people) and follow them. In theory these people should have some mutual interest but likely be outside of your bubble.

## Run
Python3 /tweepy/twitter_streaming.py
